## Description

This is my Kanban REACT app, submitted as part of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp Module 2 mini-project, February 2024 cohort.

### Proyect requirements
The React application should have the following features:
* It should be an app made for a single user.
* Navbar - A component that displays the name and the logo of the app, shown on all the pages.
* Footer - A component that displays a link to the GitHub repo of the project, shown on all the pages.
* Sidebar - A sidebar component shown on all the pages. The component should display links to pages added to the app at a later stage.
* Items List - A list of items showing the JSON data.
* Conditional Rendering - Conditionally render content using boolean properties from the project’s JSON data.
* Delete Items - A button on each list item that allows the user to delete the item from the list.
* Item Details Page - A page showing the details of the selected item from the list of items.
* About Page - A page showing the project description and information about the team members (students) working on the project, including links to their GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
* Not Found Page - A page shown whenever the user navigates to a URL route that doesn’t exist in the app.
* Create Item Form - A form that allows the user to create a new item and add it to the items list.
* Update Item Form - A form that allows the user to update an existing item on the list.
* Keep your code clean and organized by using descriptive variable names, correct indentation, removing any unused code, and maintaining proper file structure and naming.
* Extra: Display a toast with feedback whenever a task is successfully created, updated, or deleted.
* Extra: The user should be able to easily move tasks between columns by dragging and dropping them.

##### Questions to ask Daniel or Dustin:
1. Why does the html get formated in a different way for the footer component?
2. Which CSS file can I change - > app or index?
